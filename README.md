# Captcha_Recognition_Using_CNN
This project implements a CAPTCHA recognition system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The model is trained to identify and decode distorted, colored, and noisy CAPTCHA images accurately. It includes image preprocessing, segmentation, and a CNN-based character recognition pipeline.
